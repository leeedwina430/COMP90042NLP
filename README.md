# COMP90042NLP
THe subject materials, including 2 assignments and the final project.

The final project was completed within 2 days, so there're lots of areas to improve. 

The models are trained with A100 on a server using Pytorch. For the aim of submission, added `.ipynb` files which run on `colab`.

Note: It would be much faster if one upload the date on their google drive, then amounting it in colab before running.
